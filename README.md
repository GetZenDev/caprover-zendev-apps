## Repo for CapRover One Click Apps

This repository provides **Caprover** one-click templates for the following applications:
* coturn
* openfire

For the build to work, make sure:
* workflow actions are configured for main or master - depending on the settings
* create gh-pages branch and configure github pages on that brunch (that's where the compiled code is published)
